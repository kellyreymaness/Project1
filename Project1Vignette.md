# Introduction

<br> This vignette will walk you through how to connect with data
through an API. Specifically, we will look at how to access certain
endpoints (tables) as well as how join returned datasets, create new
variables, and explore the data through basic summarization and
graphing. <br>

## Required Packages

<br> To get started, weâ€™ll need to ensure we have the tools installed
and loaded into RStudio to read in, manipulate, summarize, and plot the
data. Below is an outline of packages that are required to for this
project: <br>

  - **dplyr**: for data manipulation
  - **DT**: for creating interactive data tables.
  - **ggplot2**: for plotting and graphing
  - **readr**: for reading in data
  - **tibble**: for creating special data frames with improved printing
    properties
  - **tidyr**: for reshaping data
